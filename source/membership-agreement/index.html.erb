      <h2>Our Mission Statement:</h2>
      <p>Skiff Mates [people, coworkers and community groups] who participate in The Skiff's community and use The Skiff's space [30 Cheapside, Brighton, East Sussex.

      <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>We aren't big on rules, per se, but weve figured out that not everyone inherently understands the principles of participation, community and being a good neighbour, so we've put together a few points for everyone to keep in mind.</p>

      <li>If a Chief Mate asks you to leave you must skedaddle.</li>
      <li>Internet is priceless (be responsible and respectful. No bit-torrent, no PrOn).</li>
      <li>Respect privacy, confidentiality and safety of people, property and data.</li>
      <li>Cleaning up, leaving the space as you found it and recycling are house rules.</li>
