      <p class="lead">
        While The Skiff doesn't have any full-time staff it does have a handful of people who are ultimately responsible for it. The help keep The Skiff on the right course. From making sure emails get answered to keeping an eye on cashflow.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The Skiff is in the process of becoming member owned. Over 130 long term Skiffmates currently own just over 12% of The Skiff Ltd. Two of our six board members represent Skiffmates interests. The Skiff's cofounders Jonathan and Anna Markwell own just under 44%. And just under 44% is owned by Wired Sussex Ltd which is a not-profit organisation setup by the local digital community. More ownership is granted to members each spring at no cost to them. In the long term it is our intension that members of The Skiff will collectively own and control the largest stake in The Skiff.
