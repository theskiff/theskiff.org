  <h3>1. How did you get into becoming a designer?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
I've always enjoyed experimenting with art and design. I spent five years working in a design agency after graduating university where I contributed to a wide range of web, print and branding projects. I then gained a formal design qualification to explore a more creative direction for my work. That was 10 years ago. I’ve since followed a path that lead to me starting my own freelance business and niching in the tech industry.
  </p>

  <h3>2. What are you designing this week?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
Over the last few months I've been working on a brand refresh for Mind the Product. Now that's signed off I've been working on a plan to implement the new brand online. I also have two illustration projects on the go, one for an events management SaaS product, and the other for an online support SaaS product. Both of these will be used by the client to help humanise their product interface, and introduce some memorable brand visuals to their marketing sites.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Who are your favourite clients?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
I've spent much of the last two years working with Mind the Product, the internationally acclaimed conference for product managers.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
Being part of the Mind the Product team since 2018 has been a fantastic experience and offered me some brilliant insight into the product world.
  </p>

  <h3>4. What kind of design did they hire you to do?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
Working with the existing brand I created a refreshed visual language and a library of reusable components to help speed up the development of various features of the Mind the Product online experience. And as mentioned earlier, I have just completed a brand refresh which will be implemented across their website, marketing and printed conference materials.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
During the last two Mind the Product conferences at the Barbican in London I helped run a design research lab, conducting user interviews so that I could better understand the needs of real users of the site.
  </p>


  <h3>5. Why did they choose you to do the design over anyone else?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
Few designers (and even fewer illustrators) seem to specialise on a particular industry. My experience in working with software product businesses was a great fit for Mind the Product. Their audience overlaps almost exactly with the clients I had previously worked with.
  </p>

  <h3>6. What advice would you give to someone trying to choose someone like you to work with?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
Try to find someone who really understands your industry and has worked with similar businesses to your own. Make sure they show some evidence of using design systems so you don't become completely dependent on them every time you need to make small changes to your products or websites.
  </p>

  <h3>7. What do you like to do with your time when you’re not working?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
I do lots of illustration in my spare time: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/meg_ladoodle">https://www.instagram.com/meg_ladoodle</a>. I also love snowboarding, mountain biking and paddle boarding with my family.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Why did you decide to join The Skiff?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
I've been a member of the skiff for about 7 years now. When I started I was working with another member already so it made sense to join her so we could collaborate more closely.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
I've stayed so long for more reasons than I can list here are a few off the top of my head: The Skiff is not corporate, not trendy and not curated. It's a community of curious minds who form new collaborations at the lunch table. If you want to hang fairy lights next to your desk, you can. You can stay behind for a drink on a Friday and not get home until 1am - because you’ve been up talking about stuff that wouldn’t interest your other friends. People here want to hear about your freelance problems and help you to solve them. And they care if you get ill. There's a bell that has to be rung when there’s cake - and it rings a lot!
  </p> 

  <h3>9. What advice would you give a new Skiffmate?</h3>


  <p class="lead">
I now have a permanent desk upstairs in the Gloucester Studio (the one with all
the plants) - which incidentally is the best room and I urge new peeps to come and join us up here for a day or so to see if you like it!
  </p> 

  <h3>10. What would you like a fellow Skiffmate to ask you about?</h3>

  <p class="lead">
As many Skiffmates are more technical than artistic, I'd love to talk to them more about the importance of aesthetics in user experience. As well as the role of delight in creating products that people love to use. Ask me why I think a small investment in a brand illustration system for a start-up product can provide huge ROI in terms of brand recognition and user enjoyment.
