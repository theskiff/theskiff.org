    - The people at The Skiff are friendly and helpful. They work in a wide range of different industries which gives many opportunities to gain insights that you would not be able to get on your own.
    - The Skiff is a place where you can focus on work when you need to and chat and socialise when you want to.
    - There are a variety of working areas to suit your mood and regular social events like Show & Tell, Thursday pastries, and Skiff Drinks every other Friday.
    - For me, as a freelance mobile app developer, the real benefit of The Skiff is finding great people to collaborate with. Since joining, I have worked with many other Skiffmates and been referred to clients I would not have otherwise.
    - The Skiff has been a brilliant place to work and meet people. After just 8 months of working from home and coffee shops, The Skiff was exactly what I needed to stop myself going crazy.
    - The space is relaxed and socialble with regular events such as weekly "show & tells" and biweekly Friday drinks.
    - It's a great place to meet all sorts of freelancers and remote workers (not just techie types!) and exchange ideas and work. Highly recommended!

     - The Skiff is a place where all different kinds of people can come together and share a collective creative space.
     - It’s perfect for batting ideas around and getting help in disciplines I maybe don’t know so much about.
     - It’s been really eye-opening (and fun!) learning about what other people do and seeing the amazing things everyone else is working on.
     - The best part is the atmosphere. It’s really welcoming and comfortable, so it’s the perfect home away from home! 
     - For me, as a writer, the real benefit of The Skiff is bouncing around ideas. I’ve learned tons about other industries, which I’ve been able to weave into my client work, but it’s also a really creative place filled with people with amazing ideas.
     - If I’m ever struggling with a piece (fiction or non-fiction), I know I’ll always have someone to ask for help!
     - I decided the Skiff’s laidback atmosphere and vibrant social scene was exactly what I needed.

  quotes:
    - Deciding to rent co-working desk space at The Skiff has been an excellent investment.
    - Within my first month I won freelance contracts through introductions from other 'Skiffmates' that more than covered the cost of my first year's membership.
    - The space is dedicated to freelancers, not small businesses, so we don't get crowded out or treated like 2nd-class members as can happen in other Brighton co-working spaces.
    - The social side is great too, I've made many new friends since working here.

#     - I discovered the Skiff from a freelancers networking event and am over the moon I did as I didn't even know these co-working spaces existed! Considering the facilities on offer, and the time and energy The Skiff put into bringing everyone together, it's excellent value for money.
