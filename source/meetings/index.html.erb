        <h3>PLEASE NOTE</h3>

        <p>On the day of your booking please ensure that one of your group is responsible for letting members of your team in.&nbsp;We don't have any paid staff and it's very disruptive to coworkers to have to keep getting up and down to let in people who may be strangers to them. We are a community rather than a serviced office (such as Regus). Things work best at The Skiff when users of the space are conscious of their responsibility to look after themselves, support other members of the community and care for the space. Thank you!</p>


        <h3>Cancellation policy</h3>


        <p>You can cancel up to four hours before your meeting is due to commence. Please do this using the link in your booking confirmation email.</p>
