        The Skiff is a community first and a workspace second. When you join you're not a customer, client, tennant or guest. You'll become a member. And members of The Skiff are known as Skiffmates.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        Skiffmates have personally choosen to be members of The Skiff. We're not here because our employers want us to be here. We've all experienced the challenges of working from home. Some of us choose to work here all the time. But most of us find 1 to 3 days a week in the company of others makes a huge difference to our productivity and wellbeing.

    <h2 class="mt-5">What you'll get from the community</h2>

    <p class="lead">
     Some members have got more work as a result of the relationships they've built here. Others have become recognised local authorities on topics by running events here. Many have made lasting friendships here.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      We don't have any VIPs, corporate members or teams that need to be treated differently from everyone else. If you work one day a week you should feel just as much of a sense of belonging as someone who has a dedicated desk.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      What you get from your membership is up to you. The more you participate, and take time to get to know your fellow coworkers, the more you'll feel at home.
